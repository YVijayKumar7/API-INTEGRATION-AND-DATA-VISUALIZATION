## E-Commerce Data Analysis & AI Chatbot Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This is an integrated E-Commerce Data Analysis project developed as part of my CODTECH internship. It includes:

1. **API Integration & Data Visualization** – Fetches e-commerce data from APIs and visualizes using Python libraries.
2. **Automated Report Generation** – Generates formatted PDF reports from analyzed data using FPDF or ReportLab.
3. **AI Chatbot with NLP** – An interactive chatbot to query data insights using NLTK for natural language processing.
4. **ML Model for Purchase Prediction** – Predicts customer purchase likelihood based on historical data using Machine Learning.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- **Requests** for API Integration
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for data visualization
- **FPDF / ReportLab** for PDF report generation
- **NLTK** for chatbot NLP processing
- **Streamlit** (optional) for interactive dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook** for model prototyping

  # Features
Fetches data via API requests and saves to local CSV for analysis.
Visualizes revenue, orders, and top products using clean graphs.
Generates automated PDF reports summarizing KPIs.  
Chatbot answers questions like revenue, total orders, top products.
ML model predicts purchase probability to enhance business decisions.

# Task 1 – API Integration & Data Visualization

## 📌 Overview

This script fetches e-commerce data from a public or mock API, processes it using **pandas**, and visualizes insights like revenue trends, order counts, and top products using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- requests
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run the script:
python api_integration.py
View output graphs in the displayed windows or saved PNG files.

📈 Features
API data fetching and parsing
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Revenue, orders, and product sales visualizations

 # Future Enhancements
Deploy chatbot as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
Automate daily PDF report emails.
Improve ML model with hyperparameter tuning and advanced algorithms.
Integrate database storage for real-time querying.
The PDF report will be generated and saved in the project directory.
Download required NLTK resources:
Interact in the terminal to get revenue, orders, and top products information.
# Features

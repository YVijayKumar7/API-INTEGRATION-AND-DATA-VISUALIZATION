## E-Commerce Data Analysis & AI Chatbot Project

## üìå Project Overview

This is an integrated E-Commerce Data Analysis project developed as part of my CODTECH internship. It includes:

1. **API Integration & Data Visualization** ‚Äì Fetches e-commerce data from APIs and visualizes using Python libraries.
2. **Automated Report Generation** ‚Äì Generates formatted PDF reports from analyzed data using FPDF or ReportLab.
3. **AI Chatbot with NLP** ‚Äì An interactive chatbot to query data insights using NLTK for natural language processing.
4. **ML Model for Purchase Prediction** ‚Äì Predicts customer purchase likelihood based on historical data using Machine Learning.
